# A00 Baseline Interaction Patch Report

## Summary of Pass 1 Changes

- `02_analyitical_foundation/A00_Aggregate_Transformation_Benchmark.md`: created the exact requested A00 note. It defines A00 as aggregate $K_t$, time-varying $\theta_t$, with the baseline interaction relation:

$$
y_t = c + \beta_1 k_t + \beta_2(\omega_t k_t) + \xi_t,
$$

and the implied mapping:

$$
\theta_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2\omega_t.
$$

- `02_analyitical_foundation/A00_Aggregate_Benchmark.md`: converted the older A00 note into a legacy alias for the locked A00 note so the vault no longer retains a conflicting constant-$\theta$ benchmark.
- `02_analyitical_foundation/A03_TransformationElasticity_Two-CapitalCapacityComposition.md`: patched the A00/A03 boundary. A03 is now framed as decomposing the A00 aggregate $\theta_t$ into $K^{ME}$, $K^{NRC}$, and $s_t$, not as the first source of time variation.
- `03_econometrics/N01_CapacityUtilization_StructuralObject.md`: patched the transformation-elasticity section so $\omega_t k_t$ is named as the A00 baseline econometric object, not an optional example.
- `03_econometrics/M10_Empirical_Identification_Framework.md`: patched the empirical scaffold so the sequence is A00 aggregate interaction relation, $\hat{\theta}_t$, $\hat{Y}_t^p$, level anchoring, and $\hat{\mu}_t$. Added A03/A04 activation boundaries.
- `03_econometrics/R04_FMOLS_structural_preservation.md`: patched the FM-OLS argument so FM-OLS is preferred because it preserves the A00 structural regressor matrix and the mapping $\beta_1 + \beta_2\omega_t$.

## Summary of Pass 2 Changes

- `03_econometrics/N02_SuperConsistency.md`: patched the note so super-consistency is explicitly tied to first-layer coefficient recovery in the A00 aggregate interaction benchmark. The methodological claim remains intact: super-consistency secures coefficient recovery, not $\mu_t$ reconstruction.
- `03_econometrics/R05_LRV_kernel_bandwidth_regime_misalignment.md`: patched the term "global" so it means global estimation of the A00 time-varying interaction mapping, not constant $\theta$. The note now states that FM-OLS can support global A00 reconstruction but cannot by itself identify regime-dependent transformation elasticities.

## Report-Only Review

### `03_econometrics/R01_residual_vs_structural_identification.md`

- decision: no_patch_needed
- reason: The note already enforces the residual-identification guardrail and does not conflict with A00.
- exact phrase or section inspected: "Capacity utilization is not identified by a residual." and "A residual can diagnose failure or describe remaining variation, but it cannot identify $Y_t^p$ or $\mu_t$."
- proposed replacement text: none

### `03_econometrics/R02_DOLS_reconstruction_dilemma.md`

- decision: no_patch_needed
- reason: The note defines DOLS as an estimator-layer correction and blocks direct reconstruction claims. It does not demote the A00 interaction or imply constant $\theta$.
- exact phrase or section inspected: "DOLS can support the first step. It cannot complete the rest."
- proposed replacement text: none

### `03_econometrics/R03_super_consistency_mechanics_hinge.md`

- decision: no_patch_needed
- reason: The "global" language concerns estimator scope and coefficient stability, not constant $\theta$. R05 now clarifies the global-A00 terminology for the FM-OLS layer.
- exact phrase or section inspected: "All three estimators are global. They assume a stable long-run relation across the sample."
- proposed replacement text: none

### `03_econometrics/R06_IMOLS_integration_ladder_reconstruction.md`

- decision: no_patch_needed
- reason: The interaction discussion is a technical sequencing rule for IM-OLS. It does not define the baseline relation and does not conflict with A00.
- exact phrase or section inspected: "If the specification contains interaction terms, the order of operations matters."
- proposed replacement text: none

### `03_econometrics/R07_FGLS_threshold_cointegration_admissibility.md`

- decision: no_patch_needed
- reason: The note assigns FGLS to the regime layer and blocks residual utilization. Its global-estimator warning concerns regime-specific parameters, not a constant A00 $\theta_t$.
- exact phrase or section inspected: "DOLS, FM-OLS, and IM-OLS are global long-run estimators."
- proposed replacement text: none

### `03_econometrics/R08_threshold_break_diagnostics_to_FGLS.md`

- decision: no_patch_needed
- reason: The note only defines the diagnostic path from break testing to threshold-FGLS. It does not redefine A00, demote the interaction term, or treat residuals as utilization.
- exact phrase or section inspected: "The diagnostic ladder comes first. The regime estimator comes second."
- proposed replacement text: none

## Remaining Risks or Unresolved Issues

- Several non-target notes still discuss global estimators or stable relations in generic terms. After the R05 clarification, this should be read as estimator-scope language, not a constant-$\theta$ A00 claim.
- `03_econometrics/R09_structural_break_protocol.md` already contains the locked interaction equation and was not part of the requested patch set.

## Follow-up Hygiene Pass

- N01 was directly verified. It contains the A00 baseline relation and the implied $\theta_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2\omega_t$ mapping.
- N01 required a minor wording patch so the interaction term is named with the required A00 baseline-device wording.
- The A00 YAML link was added to `02_analyitical_foundation/A03_TransformationElasticity_Two-CapitalCapacityComposition.md`, `03_econometrics/N01_CapacityUtilization_StructuralObject.md`, `03_econometrics/M10_Empirical_Identification_Framework.md`, `03_econometrics/R04_FMOLS_structural_preservation.md`, `03_econometrics/N02_SuperConsistency.md`, and `03_econometrics/R05_LRV_kernel_bandwidth_regime_misalignment.md`.
- The A00/A03 notation bridge was added to A03. It distinguishes A00's empirical $\theta_t$ path from A03's analytical $\theta^N(\pi,s)$ decomposition without changing the theory.
- YAML validation passed after the follow-up changes.
