# Parameter Stability and Window Discipline in S30

## Core claim

S30 should treat parameter stability as a guardrail on the long-run transformation relation, not as an invitation to search for the window with the most attractive coefficient.

The admissible protocol is:

$$
\text{pre-declared historical windows}
\rightarrow
\text{same cointegrating specification across windows}
\rightarrow
\text{estimator triangulation}
\rightarrow
\text{formal or proxy stability check}
\rightarrow
\text{diagnostic rolling/recursive inspection}.
$$

The window is never promoted because it produces the desired sign, magnitude, or significance. It is promoted only if it survives the estimator, neighborhood, collinearity, and stability checks.

---

## 1. Problem definition

The S30 object is a single-equation long-run transformation relation between output, capital, distribution, and capital composition. The baseline empirical variables are:

$$
\{y_t, k_t, \omega_t, \omega^K_t, s_t^{proxy}, \phi_t^{proxy}, s_{t,cc}^{proxy}, \phi_{t,cc}^{proxy}, pK^{ME/NRC}_t\}.
$$

The composition variables are Tier-B ME--NRC component proxies for an NFCorp-centered transformation relation. They are not direct NFCorp-by-asset-type capital-stock splits. That matters because instability in their coefficients may reflect three different objects:

1. instability in the long-run transformation relation;
2. fragility from proxy construction and composition measurement;
3. local collinearity or window sensitivity in a small annual macro sample.

S30 therefore needs a protocol that distinguishes parameter instability from proxy fragility. It also needs to avoid two symmetric errors: choosing windows arbitrarily from coefficient appeal, and overreacting by turning the chapter into a specialized structural-break econometrics paper.

---

## 2. Literature map and method classification

| Method family | S30 classification | Function in S30 | Boundary rule |
|---|---:|---|---|
| FM-OLS | CORE estimator | Main estimator for the long-run transformation relation because it preserves the theoretical regressor matrix while correcting endogeneity and serial correlation. | It estimates the long-run coefficient vector; it does not identify regimes by itself. |
| IM-OLS | CORE robustness estimator | Robustness check against DOLS-style lead-lag augmentation and FM-OLS kernel/bandwidth dependence. | It is not a separate stability-testing literature; stability belongs to the cointegrating model, not to the IM-OLS label. |
| DOLS | DIAGNOSTIC / stress estimator | Fragility check using dynamic augmentation. | DOLS leads/lags reduce effective sample size and may be unstable in short annual windows. |
| Hansen-type instability tests | CORE stability check | Formal benchmark for parameter instability in regressions with $I(1)$ processes. | Preferred stability evidence when implementable. |
| Gregory--Hansen tests | SUPPORTING | Tests whether cointegration is recovered once one unknown regime shift is allowed. | Use only when the question becomes one-break cointegration, not as the default stability protocol. |
| Andrews unknown-break tests | SUPPORTING | Provides the general unknown-break logic behind sup-type tests. | Background logic, not a license to apply stationary OLS break tests as main evidence. |
| Rolling and recursive estimates | DIAGNOSTIC | Graphical and local-sensitivity evidence. | They are thermometers, not birth certificates for regimes. |
| Johansen recursive diagnostics | DIAGNOSTIC / secondary comparison | System-level comparison if the single-equation reading needs cross-checking. | Do not let CVAR diagnostics displace the S30 single-equation design. |
| Bai--Perron | TOO HEAVY FOR MAIN PAPER | Multiple-break dating in linear models. | Appendix only unless multiple-break dating becomes the substantive question. |
| Kejriwal--Perron | TOO HEAVY FOR MAIN PAPER | Multiple structural changes in cointegrated regressions. | Methodologically appropriate but excessive for the main chapter unless multiple breaks become central. |
| Ordinary OLS break tests | NOT APPROPRIATE | At most a secondary descriptive sensitivity check. | Do not use as primary evidence for instability in $I(1)$ cointegrating regressions. |

## 3. Role of Hansen-type parameter-instability tests

Hansen-type tests are the natural benchmark because they address parameter instability in regressions involving $I(1)$ processes. That is the correct problem class for S30.

The target is not whether a stationary OLS regression has a break. The target is whether the cointegrating vector that supports the long-run transformation relation can be treated as reasonably stable over the relevant sample or window.

The preferred rule is:

> Apply a Hansen-type parameter-instability test, or the closest implementable equivalent, to the main FM-OLS specification and report the result as the formal stability screen.

If the exact Hansen procedure is not available in the implementation stack, the replacement must be labeled carefully. Empirical fluctuation or recursive-constancy tests can be used as operational proxies, but the note and paper should not present them as exact equivalents to Hansen's original statistics.

This distinction protects the chapter from a common mistake: using whatever software can run as if it were the test required by the design. Useful, yes. Equivalent, no. Econometrics is not a costume party. ⚙️

---

## 4. Role of Gregory--Hansen tests

Gregory--Hansen tests belong to a more specific question:

> Does the relation become cointegrated once the model allows one unknown regime shift?

That is not the same as the general S30 question of whether the estimated long-run coefficient vector is stable across historically meaningful windows.

Use Gregory--Hansen only under clear triggers:

1. full-sample cointegration evidence is weak or contradictory;
2. visual and historical diagnostics point toward one plausible unknown regime shift;
3. the chapter needs to test whether the relation is better described as one-break cointegration rather than stable full-sample cointegration.

Gregory--Hansen should not replace the historical-window protocol. It is a conditional module for one-break cointegration, not a general method for selecting the best historical period.

---

## 5. Role of Bai--Perron and Kejriwal--Perron

Bai--Perron and Kejriwal--Perron are powerful but heavy.

Bai--Perron is the benchmark for estimating and testing multiple structural changes in linear models. Kejriwal--Perron adapts the multiple-break problem to cointegrated regressions. The second is closer to S30's model class; the first is useful as general break-econometrics background.

For Chapter 2, their role should be limited:

- use them only as optional appendix material;
- activate them only if evidence strongly suggests multiple breaks;
- do not let them become the main selection device for S30 windows;
- do not allow break-date estimation to replace historically motivated periodization.

The reason is practical and substantive. In annual macroeconomic data, each additional break partitions an already small sample. Multiple-break estimation can become more about segment scarcity than about the transformation relation. Unless multiple-break dating is central to the argument, this is too much machine for the job.

---

## 6. Rolling and recursive estimates

Rolling-window and recursive estimates are diagnostic evidence.

They are useful for:

1. identifying local sensitivity;
2. checking whether coefficient paths drift around historical boundaries;
3. detecting windows where composition proxies become unstable;
4. showing whether FM-OLS, IM-OLS, and DOLS tell similar local stories;
5. flagging collinearity episodes before coefficient interpretation.

They are not formal regime identifiers.

The admissible language is:

> Rolling and recursive estimates are interpreted as diagnostic evidence on local coefficient sensitivity. They do not mechanically identify regimes, and they are not used to select windows ex post.

The inadmissible language is:

> The rolling coefficient changes here, therefore the regime begins here.

That sentence should not survive an audit.

---

## 7. Historical windows and estimated breakpoints

Historical windows and statistical breakpoints are different objects.

Historical windows are substantive contrasts. They are pre-declared from political-economic periodization, institutional change, and the history of accumulation. They enter S30 as benchmark comparisons.

Estimated breakpoints are model-conditional dates produced by a test. They are useful evidence, but they are not sovereign historical periodization.

The rule is:

> Historical windows define the benchmark contrasts. Statistical breakpoints test whether the data provide independent support for instability near, inside, or outside those contrasts.

If a statistically estimated breakpoint aligns with a historical boundary, the result strengthens the interpretation. If it does not align, the divergence should be reported rather than erased. The chapter should not force the statistical breakpoint to become the historical narrative, and it should not force historical periodization to impersonate statistical proof.

---

## 8. Sample-size constraints

Annual macroeconomic cointegration models are sample-hungry. S30 must report effective sample size, not only calendar span.

For each specification and window, record:

1. calendar years;
2. raw number of observations;
3. effective number of observations after missing values;
4. effective number of observations after DOLS leads/lags;
5. number of long-run regressors and interaction terms;
6. number of nuisance terms;
7. whether composition proxies are highly collinear in that window;
8. whether FM-OLS kernel/bandwidth choices materially affect results.

Small-window results should be treated as exploratory unless they retain enough observations to estimate the long-run relation without turning each coefficient into a heroic autobiography.

Operational rule:

> No window is admissible merely because it is historically interesting. It must also be econometrically estimable after accounting for regressors, interactions, missing values, and DOLS dynamic augmentation.

---

## 9. Recommended S30 protocol

The main S30 protocol should be austere and sequential.

1. Declare the baseline transformation relation before window comparison.
2. Declare the historical windows before inspecting coefficient appeal.
3. Estimate the same specification in the full sample and in each historical window.
4. Use FM-OLS as the main estimator.
5. Use IM-OLS as the robustness estimator.
6. Use DOLS as the fragility and stress diagnostic.
7. Record effective sample size and regressor count for every window-estimator pair.
8. Apply Hansen-type stability tests, or the closest implementable equivalent, to the main specification.
9. Use rolling and recursive estimates as diagnostic plots only.
10. Run Gregory--Hansen only if the question becomes one unknown regime shift in the cointegrating relation.
11. Reserve Bai--Perron/Kejriwal--Perron for optional appendix material if multiple breaks become substantively unavoidable.
12. Promote a specification or window only if it survives estimator, neighborhood, collinearity, and stability checks.

---

## 10. Promotion rule

A window or specification can be promoted only if all four checks are passed.

### Estimator check

The long-run coefficient pattern must not be an artifact of one estimator. FM-OLS should carry the main interpretation; IM-OLS should not overturn it; DOLS should reveal fragility rather than silently determine the result.

### Neighborhood check

Results should not collapse under small changes around the historical window boundary.

### Collinearity check

The composition proxies must not be so collinear that the coefficient is essentially a rotation of the regressor matrix.

### Stability check

Formal or proxy stability evidence must not contradict the claimed interpretation.

If one check fails, the result may still be reported. It should not be promoted as the benchmark S30 finding.

---

## 11. What not to do

Do not select the window because the coefficient becomes attractive.

Do not treat rolling-window estimates as proof of regimes.

Do not use ordinary OLS break tests as primary evidence for an $I(1)$ cointegrating regression.

Do not collapse historical periodization and statistically estimated breakpoints.

Do not treat Gregory--Hansen as a general substitute for parameter-stability testing.

Do not put Bai--Perron/Kejriwal--Perron in the main paper unless multiple-break dating becomes central to the argument.

Do not interpret instability in Tier-B ME--NRC proxies as immediate evidence that the theoretical transformation relation itself broke. Proxy fragility must be separated from structural instability.

---

## 12. Locked sentence for reuse

**S30 treats historical windows as pre-declared benchmark contrasts and parameter-stability evidence as a disciplinary screen. Rolling and recursive estimates diagnose sensitivity; they do not identify regimes. Gregory--Hansen is reserved for the one-break cointegration question, while Bai--Perron/Kejriwal--Perron remain appendix-level tools unless multiple-break dating becomes central to the chapter.**
